    Orbit Calendar
  </h1>
</p>
<p>Orbit is a calendar app designed to help users maintain a healthy balance between work, school, recreation, and socializing. It goes beyond a standard planner by integrating features that encourage well-rounded time management, ensuring that no aspect of life is neglected.</p>
<p>The motivation for this project is simple. Many calendar apps focus solely on scheduling events without considering the importance of balance in daily life. I wanted a tool that not only helps users stay organized but also ensures they allocate time for all essential areas. My goal is to create a smart scheduling assistant that promotes a more fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle.</p>
